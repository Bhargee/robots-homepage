  abstract = {We introduce a new approach to solving path-finding problems under uncertainty by representing them as probabilistic models and applying domain-independent inference algorithms to the models. This approach separates problem representation from the inference algorithm and provides a framework for efficient learning of path-finding policies. We evaluate the new approach on the Canadian Traveler Problem, which we formulate as a probabilistic model, and show how probabilistic inference allows high performance stochastic policies to be obtained for this problem.},
