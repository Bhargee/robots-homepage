I am a post-doc in Machine Learning at the [Department of Engineering Science](http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk) at [Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk). I work primarily on [Anglican](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/anglican), a [probabilistic programming](http://probabilistic-programming.org) language closely integrated with [Clojure](http://clojure.org), jointly with [Frank Wood](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/) and [David Tolpin](http://offtopia.net). My broader research agenda is to understand how programs may be used to define structured and composable models in machine learning and aritificial intelligence. To facilitate this agenda, I also work on inference techniques for probabilistic programs.

I am currently affiliated with the group of [Frank Wood](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/) in the [Robotics Research Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk) at Oxford. I did a [PhD](https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/15949) in biophysics with [Ray Goldstein](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold) (Cambridge) and [Wim van Saarloos](http://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/~saarloos) (Leiden). I have also worked on applications of machine learning in single-molecule biophysics at [Columbia](http://www.columbia.edu) (with [Chris Wiggins](http://www.columbia.edu/~chw2/) and [Ruben Gonzalez](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/gonzalez/index.html)).
