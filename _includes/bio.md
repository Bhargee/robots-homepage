I am a post-doc in Machine Learning. I am interested in the development of general-purpose [Probabilistic Programming Languages] (http://probabilistic-programming.org) that provide built-in constructs for inferring stochastic variables, with the aims of making it easier to iterate over different model variants in existing domains, enable new areas of application with  programs that have no known equivalent graphical model, and automatically determine the most appropriate inference strategy from the program structure.

At present I am working with [Frank Wood] (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/) in the [Robotics Research Group] (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk) within the [Department of Engineering Science] (http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk) at [Oxford] (http://www.ox.ac.uk). I am also affiliated with the [Department of Statistics] (http://stats.columbia.edu) at [Columbia] (http://www.columbia.edu). I did a [PhD](https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/15949) in biophysics with [Ray Goldstein](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold) (Cambridge) and [Wim van Saarloos](http://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/~saarloos) (Leiden). Most recently I have developed applications of machine learning in single-molecule biophysics (with [Chris Wiggins] (http://www.columbia.edu/~chw2/) and [Ruben Gonzalez] (http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/gonzalez/index.html)), primarily using [variational](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods) and [empirical Bayesian] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_Bayes) inference in [Hidden Markov Models] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_markov_model) to analyse [single-molecule FRET data](http://ebfret.github.io).
